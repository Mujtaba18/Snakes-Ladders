## Lets start with my Snakes and Ladders game Pseudo Code!!

### First I'll be creating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Files
### Then I'll start with the HTML coding, I,ll be making the body contains a section for game title, players, game image and board, dice, wins and losses, and time spent.

### Game Title
#### This section will contain only a title inside a box.

### Players Section and wins/losses
#### This section will have number of players and their color, along with their wins and losses count.

### Game Board
#### This section will have an snakes and ladders background, giving it 100 number of cells to move the players on.
#### Each snake place will have an IF statement to return him back with the number shown in the board.
#### Each Ladder will get an IF statement to increment the player and move him up the board with the number should be incremented.

### Dice
#### A dice should be shown, and each player will click on it to get a number and move.

### Time Spent
#### A time will be shown to calculate how long you spent time on the game, and maybe update it to give each player 1 minute to play or skip his turn.

### Then I,ll be customizing it with css
### Lastly, making up the JavaScript Codes!!
